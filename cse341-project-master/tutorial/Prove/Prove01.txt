3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning.
	Create prove01.js (name is up to you) file in the routes folder. (Folder already exists from download in team activity)
	Create a route to your prove01.js file in your index.js file
	In your views folder create a two .ejs files (Or pug/handlebars if you chose to use either of those)
	One view with a simple form with two inputs
	Another view to display the input back to the user
	Parse the users input on the server and send the input to second view
	Be sure to use nodemon

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
	everything is working

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
	The coolest thing i learned is actually making a server that runs and updates
	as i work on it.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
	I would add some instructions on how to link the Prove files to the website like how
	the team assignments are. It felt like that was just a given and it took me a while to 
	figure it out. Also the transition from textbook tutorial to assignment felt a bit disconnected.
	the reading explained how to write to the sever so i thought that was what we needed to do with
	the form so that waisted a lot of time. 

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   (5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements)

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
	Everything works as it should and I also added a discription to the web page,
	 a link to the home page, and a heading. to both web pages.
